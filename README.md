### Project description
* Enable users to keep track of important dates
* Provide users a reliable way to send friends/family messages on an important date
* Never forget an important date or disappoint a friend/family

**Pitch:** I can never remember my friend's and family member's *birthdays/anniversaries etc*. I need an app that allows me to enter in all my *important dates by category* and automatically blast out texts on my loved one's special days. *Never miss a special day for a friend or family member ever again!*

**MVP:** As a user I want to login and see a list of automated messages that I have previously set up so I can click on a message and edit or delete it. As a user I want to be able to create an autmated message to a friend. A message should include a send date and time and a long text field that enables the message curator the ability to send a custom message.

**Stretch:** (Mobile App) - Allow contact prospecting to migrate your contacts into the app. (Web App) - Allow for a social media sharing aspect that allows you to advertise the app on your social media platform of choice.
